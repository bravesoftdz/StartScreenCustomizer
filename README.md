    - Desktop wallpaper as background picture: You can also set your desktop wallpaper as the StartScreen background picture. And if you hide this application, it will monitor system changes and see if the wallpaper has been changed to update accordingly, it is recommended to use a group of pictures as your Windows desktop wallpaper, so you can enjoy a different picture everytime you access the Start Screen.
